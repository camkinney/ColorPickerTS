The control supports color entry in RGB, HSV or hexadecimal format. A user can also drag a hue slider to adjust the hue, or click on the gradient square to select a saturation/value for the selected hue.

Color selections can be saved off for later by right clicking the save squares in the bottom right. A left click on one of these squares updates the selected color to the saved color.
